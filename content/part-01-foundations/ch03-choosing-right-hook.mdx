# Choosing the Right Hook

The RIGHT framework for selecting hooks:

- **R**ender: Does this value affect what gets rendered?
- **I**dentity: Does this value need to persist across renders?
- **G**lobal: Is this value shared across components?
- **H**andler: Is this triggered by an event or side effect?
- **T**iming: When does this need to run?

## Quick Reference

| I need to... | Use this hook |
|--------------|---------------|
| Store UI state | `useState` |
| Store complex state | `useReducer` |
| Store non-UI value | `useRef` |
| Share state deeply | `useContext` |
| Run side effect | `useEffect` |
| Cache calculation | `useMemo` |
| Handle form | `useActionState` |
