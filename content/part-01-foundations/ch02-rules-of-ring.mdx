# Rules of the Ring

Every hook you write must follow two rules. Break them and React breaks. These aren't suggestions—they're the contract that makes hooks work.

## Learning Outcomes

After reading this chapter, you will:

- Understand the two Rules of Hooks and why they exist
- Know what "purity" means for React components
- Recognize common rule violations and how to fix them
- Configure ESLint to catch violations automatically

## The Two Rules

### Rule 1: Only Call Hooks at the Top Level

Don't call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.

### Rule 2: Only Call Hooks from React Functions

Call hooks from React function components or custom hooks only.

## Component Purity

A pure function:
1. Same inputs → same outputs
2. No side effects during execution

React expects components to be pure during render. Side effects belong in effects, event handlers, and refs.

## Summary

The Rules of Hooks aren't arbitrary—they're how React tracks state across renders. Call hooks at the top level, only from React functions, and keep your render pure.
